	/// Here's a specific example:
	/// On hsqldb, if you have a column of type DECIMAL(10, 4) and you ask for the
	/// average of the values in that column, you get the floor of the result.
	/// On MySQL, if you have a column of the same type, you get a result back with
	/// the expected precision.  So, um, just be careful.
